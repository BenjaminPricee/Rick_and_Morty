	<h2>Rick and Morty season five rumours</h2>
	<p class="news">I am aware that there will always be rumours about a season until it' released but Dan Harmon says this season is actually arriving ON TIME, stating “We’re more on schedule than we’ve ever been,”. Yeah, hope by "on schedule" they mean our "on schedule" and not Season 3's "on schedule". I'll try to keep you guys updated on that anyways.</p>
