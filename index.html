	<h2>Welcome...</h2>

	<p>...to possibly the best Rick and Morty fan site you'll find. I could go on for a while about the quality (or lack of) that this site has but the github repo says "Rick and Morty" so I guess I'll focus on those two.</p>

	<h2>What is Rick and Morty?</h2>

	<p>Rick and Morty is a show that follows two characters (you'll never guess their names) throgh a number of weird and whacky adventures. Rick, the grandfather, drags Morty, the grandson, through everything from teleporters to interdimensional portals. These lead them to unkown lands with new creatures and a variety of problems. Why Rick brings Morty with him on these so-called "adventures" is unknown to us as viewers.</p>
